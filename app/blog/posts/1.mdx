Always wanted a place to document my thoughts and share more of myself, so here we are.

While I would class myself as a very talkative person, I feel like overtime I'd run out of things to add to this page, so I'd like to format my blogs to release bi-weekly, and at a minimum include:

- What I did 
- Challenges I faced 
- What I plan to do for the future
- Notable events

plus whatever I feel like, of course. 

My past few weeks have been pretty chill. My lifestyle has been a bit all over the place. Had a horrible sleep schedule for about a week where I got nothing done; I've been getting these really sudden hits of motivation to get work done (although I often end up procrastinating).  
 
If I were to sum up my life right now, I'd categorise it into 3, maybe 4 parts if I were to include my social life: work, uni and ozmath. OzMath is my problem child right now, for some reason I thought it was a good idea to build a project that was 30% coding 70% data entry. At the moment I'm rebuilding the entire UI/UX design.

Although I'm a bit bummed that I have to rebuild the whole thing, I made the choice because I was unhappy with the old design. I'm glad I learnt from my mistakes, first being to not use a pre-existing dashboard. I invested in the Berry Vue Dashboard Template, and so far, its been amazing!

Uni's been treating me well, I've got 3 assignments due this friday but I'm grateful that the workload has been really reasonable.

Work has been so good to me as well, I'm super happy with the flexible work hours and WFH options. At the moment I'm mainly clearing up what we call 'pre-checks' and 'teamqa', which are quality assurance processes. Simply put I make sure the developers' solutions are actually solutions and that they didn't break anything in the process; cause any regressions. I'm also soon to be assigned to QA our Kubernetes processes. I'm familiar with Docker and containerisation however Kubernetes and K9s is very foreign to me. Keen to see what its all about, glad that I'm given the opportunity to learn since I think DevOps isn't directly apart of our cirriculum at uni.  

Some challenges I've faced within the past few months is definitely burnout. Juggling everything at once, finding motivation to improve and just leaving the house has felt impossible at times. I'm super grateful that I have such a supportive family, partner and friends that make me feel accountable and drive me to put my all into everything that I do.

As for some notable events, I had my birthday on the 12th this month, turned 20! I feel like it was just yesterday I was mucking around in the classroom. But at the same time, I feel excited for what my future holds. I'm truly passionate in building ozmath and growing as a person alongside the people around me. What motivates me is making a positive impact to those around me. I look up to those that are truly dependable and who's 'been through it all'. I want to be someone who put their all into their work, without expectation of reward if they succeeded or not.

Okay... seems like I'm actually rambling. I'd be shocked if anyone actually read this far but if you did, thank you so much! I am always contactable @ benjamin.chau@tiny.cloud.
